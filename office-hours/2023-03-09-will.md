Today, we spent most of OH talking about modular exponentiation and
Diffie-Hellman key exchange. Stepping through the math we pick a generator `g`
to use as our base, a prime order `p` to use as our modulus, "Alice"'s private
exponent `a` and "Bob"'s private exponent `b`:

```python
$ python3
Python 3.9.16 (main, Dec  7 2022, 10:15:43)
[Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.202)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> g = 2
>>> p = 7
>>> a = 5
>>> b = 9
```

We then compute Alice's public key `A` and Bob's public key `B` by raising the
generator `g` to each respective private exponent modulo `p`:

```python
>>> A = (g ** a) % p
>>> B = (g ** b) % p
>>> A, B
(4, 1)
```

We then calculate the shared secret by raising a public key to our private
exponent, as always modulo `p`. We can see that both Alice and Bob will arrive
at the same shared secret (1 in this case):

```python
>>> (B ** a) % p
1
>>> (A ** b) % p
1
```

Here's what that looks like if we expand out the math given the above
definitions for `A` and `B`:

```python
>>> (((g ** a) % p) ** b) % p == (((g ** b) % p) ** a) % p
True
```

Of course, the above example uses trivially small numbers. In the real world,
we'd use keys of at least 1024 bits, which given in decimal:

```python
>>> 2 ** 1024
179769313486231590772930519078902473361797697894230657273430081157732675805500963132708477322407536021120113879871393357658789768814416622492847430639474124377767893424865485276302219601246094119453082952085005768838150682342462881473913110540827237163350510684586298239947245938479716304835356329624224137216
```

Finally, we reviewd XOR. Remember that anything XOR'd with itself cancels out,
so if an operand is present an even number of times in a string of XORs, it's
fully cancelled out. if it's present an odd number of times it counts once. We
also reviewed XOR's truth table and property of commutativity (i.e. ordering of
the operands doesn't matter).

```python
>>> A = 0b11111111
>>> A
255
>>> B = 0b10101010
>>> B
170
>>> C = 0b00000000
>>> C
0
>>> C = None
>>> C = A ^ B
>>> bin(C)
'0b1010101'
>>> A
255
>>> B
170
>>> bin(A), bin(B), bin(C)
('0b11111111', '0b10101010', '0b1010101')
>>> hex(A)
'0xff'
>>> hex(B)
'0xaa'
>>> 0b0 ^ 0b0 == 0b1
False
>>> 0b0 ^ 0b1 == 0b1
True
>>> 0b1 ^ 0b0 == 0b1
True
>>> 0b1 ^ 0b1 == 0b1
False
>>> C ^ C ^ B == C ^ B ^ C
True
>>> C ^ C
0
>>> C ^ C ^ B == B
True
>>> C ^ B ^ C ^ B ^ C ^ A == C ^ A
True
>>> C ^ A == B
True
```
