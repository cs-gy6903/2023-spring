# 2/6/23 (will)

We started off discussing bitwise XOR (the `^` operator in python). We reviewed
that the `0b` prefix before an integer literal denotes that that integer is
expressed in binary form. For example, in the python REPL below, we see that
base-2 `0b11` evaluates to base-10 integer `3`.

```python
$ python3
Python 3.10.6 (main, Sep 28 2022, 16:04:28) [Clang 14.0.0 (clang-1400.0.29.102)] on darwin
Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
>>> type(0b0)
<class 'int'>
>>> 0b0
0
>>> 0b11
3
```

As a refresher, we reviewed the truth table for XOR:


```python
>>> 0b0 ^ 0b0
0
>>> 0b0 ^ 0b1
1
>>> 0b1 ^ 0b0
1
>>> 0b1 ^ 0b1
0
```

We see below that XOR operations can be strung together. Note that XOR is
_commutative_, meaning that ou can swap the order of operands arbitrarily and
the expression will still evaluate to the same value. See [here][1] for a full
list of XOR's mathematical properties (note that it shares many with addition
and multiplication).

In XOR, each bit in the final result is set to 1 if that positional bit is set
for an odd number of the operands in the expression, else 0. Note that in the
examples below, while we specify the int values being operated on as `0b`
binary literals, the result is given in base-10/decimal:

```python
>>> 0b1 ^ 0b1 ^ 0b0
0
>>> 0b1 ^ 0b1 ^ 0b1
1
>>> 0b11111111 ^ 0b11111111
0
>>> 0b11110000 ^ 0b00001111
255
>>> 0b11110000 ^ 0b00001111 == 0b11111111
True
>>> 0b11111111 ^ 0b11111111 ^ 0b11111111
255
>>> 0b11110000 ^ 0b00001111 ^ 0b01010101 == 0b10101010
True
```

We also saw that XOR is not defined over `bytes` objects:

```python
>>> b'\x00\xff' ^ b'\xff\x00'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ^: 'bytes' and 'bytes'
```

Wait what's a `bytes` object?! It's like a `str`, but is a collection of
integer-valued bytes valued between 0 and 255 (inclusive). `bytes` are
specified by prefixing string quotes with a `b`. In the example below, you see
a `bytes` specified with 2 bytes of maximal value. The `\x` prefix indicates
that the two following characters are interpreted as hexadecimal byte values.
In this case, we have 2 bytes of maximal value, `FF` in hex, equal to
`0b11111111` in binary or `255` in decimal:

```python
>>> b'\xff\xff'
b'\xff\xff'
>>> type(b'\xff\xff')
<class 'bytes'>
```

NOTE: binary literal ints and `bytes` literals are different! however, when we
index into a `bytes`, we get an int (i.e. the integer value of the byte at that
position:

```python
>>> type(0b11111111)
<class 'int'>
>>> type(b'\xff')
<class 'bytes'>
>>> b'\xff'[0] == 0b11111111
True
```

You can convert between a `str` and a `bytes` using these methods (note that
it's best practice to include the encoding in the call to encode/decode, but we
elide that here for concision):

```python
>>> 'hello'.encode()
b'hello'
>>> b'hello'.decode()
'hello'
```

```python
>>> b'hello'[0]
104
>>> 'hello'[0]
'h'
```

See [here][2] in the resources doc for more pointers and examples on `bytes`.

Remember how we said that python's XOR operation isn't defined over bytes?
You'll need to define it for yourself. We give you a sample implementation in
the [resources doc][3]:

```python
>>> b'\x00\xff' ^ b'\xff\x00'
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for ^: 'bytes' and 'bytes'

>>> import functools
>>> def xor(*args: bytes) -> bytes:
...     """
...     >>> xor(b'hello', b'world')
...     b'\x1f\n\x1e\x00\x0b'
...     >>> xor(b'hello', b'world', b'hello') # note it has >2 parameters
...     b'world'
...     >>> xor(xor(b'hello', b'world'), b'hello') # equivalent to above but longer :D
...     b'world'
...     """
...     return bytes(functools.reduce(lambda a, b: a ^ b, i) for i in zip(*args))
...
>>> xor(b'\x00\xff', b'\xff\x00')
b'\xff\xff'
>>> xor(b'\x00\xff', b'\xff\x00', b'\x00\xff')
b'\xff\x00'
>>> xor(b'\x00\xff', b'\xff\x00', b'\x00\xff', b'\xff')
b'\x00'
>>> xor(b'\x00\xff', b'\xff\x00', b'\x00\xff', b'')
b''
```

You can see above that this implementation takes an arbitrary number of
arguments, but truncates the length of the output to that of the shortest
input.

Finally, we went over function signatures and definitions. Below is a toy
function that demonstrates the different parts of the function definition.
python3 has type hints, and below the `: int` is the type of input parameter
`n`. `-> typing.List[int]` indicates that the function returns a list of
`int`s.

```python
>>> import typing
>>> def expand(n: int) -> typing.List[int]:
...     """
...     Given an input integer n, output a list of n integers from 1 to n inclusive.
...     """
...     ret = []
...     for i in range(n):
...             ret.append(i + 1)
...     return ret
...
>>> expand(1)
[1]
>>> expand(5)
[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
>>> type(1), type(expand(1))
(<class 'int'>, <class 'list'>)
```

We also went through the problems in ps1 and discussed what each problem
requires. As it turns out, there's **a lot** of overlap between what ps1 asks
you to do and what the resources doc shows you how to do!

Below we given an example of a function using list comprehension:

```python
>>> def get_chars_for_bytes(inpt: bytes) -> typing.List['str']:
...     """
...     Take bytes as input and output a list of character representation for each byte
...     """
...     return [chr(i) for i in inpt]
...
>>> get_chars_for_bytes(b'hello')
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```

And there's the exact same function, but implemented using a classic `for`
loop:

```python
>>> def get_chars_for_bytes(inpt: bytes) -> typing.List['str']:
...     ret = []
...     for i in inpt:
...             ret.append(chr(i))
...     return ret
...
>>> get_chars_for_bytes(b'hello')
['h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o']
```
