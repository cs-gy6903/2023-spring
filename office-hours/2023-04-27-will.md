Attendance was pretty light for this OH. Mostly discussed the difference
between `str` representations of hex integers and `bytes`.

Given:

```python
>>> type(hello_str)
<class 'str'>

>>> hello_bytes = hello_str.encode()
>>> hello_bytes
b'hello'
```

The `bytes.hex()` method gives us a `str` representation of the hex digits
comprising `b'hello'`:

```python
>>> hello_bytes.hex()
'68656c6c6f'

>>> type(hello_bytes.hex())
<class 'str'>
```

Knowing that `str.encode()` returns us a `bytes`, we can see that though the
_types_ of a `str.encode()` and our original `b'hello` object are equal (i.e.
they're both `bytes`):

```python
>>> type(hello_bytes) == type(hello_bytes.hex().encode())
True
```

The values returned by those two functions are not equal:

```python
>>> hello_bytes == hello_bytes.hex().encode()
False

>>> hello_bytes
b'hello'

>>> hello_bytes.hex().encode()
b'68656c6c6f'
```

When working in `bytes`, it's always important to keep this distinction in mind
-- just because it _looks_ like hex when printed, it is often just the a-f0-9
ASCII values. This can be quite confusing. Try to standardize on _one form of
`str`-typed representation_ when you print for debugging.
